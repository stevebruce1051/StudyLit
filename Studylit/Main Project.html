        Here, you will find the whole story.<br/>
        <h2>The Old Man, His Children, and the Bundle of Sticks.</h2><br/>
CHEAP REPOSITORY.<br/>
A FABLE.<br/>
A Good old, man, no matter where,<br/><!--Represents a line break-->
Whether in York or Lancashire,<br/>
Or on a hill or in a dale,<br/>
It cannot much concern the tale;<br/>
Had children very much like others,<br/>sfvkfokagoku0i8
Compos'd of sisters and brothers;<br/>
In life he had not much to give,<br/>
But his example how to live;<br/>
His luck was what his neighbours had,<br/>
For some were good and some were bad;<br/>
When of their father death bereft 'em.<br/>
His good advice was all he left 'em.<br/>
The good old man who long had lain.<br/>
Afflicted with disease and pain;<br/>
With difficulty drew his breath,<br/>
And felt the sure approach of death.<br/>
He still had liv'd an honest life,<br/>
Kind to his neighbour and his wife;<br/>
His practice good, his faith was found,<br/>
He built his hope on scripture ground,<br/>
And knowing life hangs on a breath,<br/>
He always liv'd prepard for death.<br/>
He trusted God, nor fear'd to die,<br/>
May it be thus with you and I!<br/>
Nor let us hope to die content,<br/>
Unless our life be wisely spent.<br/>
He call'd his children round his bed<br/>
And thus unto them all he said:<br/>
Alas! alas! my children dear,<br/>
I well perceive my end is near;<br/>
I suffer much, but kiss the rod,<br/>
And bow me to the will of God.<br/>
Yet ere from you I'm quite removd,<br/>
From you whom always I have lov'd;<br/>
I wish to give you all my blessing,<br/>
And leave you with a useful lesson;<br/>
That when I've left this world of care,<br/>
Each may his testimony bear,<br/>
How much my latest thought inclin'd<br/>
To prove me tender, good, and kind!<br/>
Observe that faggot on the ground,<br/>
With twisted hazel firmly bound:—<br/>
The children turn'd their eyes that way,<br/>
And view'd the faggot as it lay;<br/>
But wonder'd what their father meant;<br/>
Who thus expounded his intent.<br/>
I wish that all of you wou'd take it,<br/>
And try if any one can break it.<br/>
Obedient to the good old man,<br/>
They all to try their strength began;<br/>
Now boy now girl; now he now she,<br/>
Apply'd the faggot to their knee;<br/>
They tugg'd and straind and tryd again,<br/>
But still they tugg'd and tryd in vain;<br/>
In vain their strength and skill exerted,<br/>
The faggot ev'ry effort thwarted.<br/>
And when their labour vain they found,<br/>
They threw the faggot on the ground.<br/>
Again the good old man proceeded,<br/>
To give th' instruction which they needed;<br/>
Untwist, says he, the hazel bind,<br/>
And let the faggot be disjoin'd;<br/>
Then stick by stick, and twig by twig,<br/>
The little children and the big,<br/>
Foll'wing the words their father spoke.<br/>
Each sprig and spray they quickly broke;<br/>
There father! all began to cry,<br/>
I've broken mine! and I, and I.<br/>
Replied the Sire, 'twas my intent,<br/>
My family to represent;<br/>
While you are join'd in friendships thong,<br/>
My dearest children, you'll be strong;<br/>
But if by quarrel and dispute,<br/>
You undermine affection's root,<br/>
And thus the strength'ning cord divide,<br/>
Then will my children ill betide:<br/>
E'en beasts of prey in bands unite,<br/>
And kindly for each other fight;<br/>
And shall not Christian children be,<br/>
Join'd in sweet links of amity?<br/>
If separate, you'll each be weak,<br/>
Each like a single stick will break;<br/>
But if you're firm, and true and hearty,<br/>
The world and all its spite can't part ye.<br/>
The father having clos'd his lesson,<br/>
Proceeded to pronounce his blessing:<br/>
Embrac'd them all, then prayd and fighd,<br/>
Look'd up, then dropt his head—and dyd.<br/>
And thus, my countrymen shou'd you,<br/>
And I, and all, be firm and true;<br/>
If christian faith and love combine us,<br/>
And sweet affection's cords intwine us;<br/>
We need encourage no dejection,<br/>
Secure in the Divine Protection.<br/>
In prosperous days we'll bless our GOD,<br/>
And when he smites we'll kiss the rod.<br/>
